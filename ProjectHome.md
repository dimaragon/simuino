Simuino is an Arduino UNO/MEGA Pin Simulator.

You can download the terminal version (latest version is v0.2.0) at web.simuino.com.
NOTE: Downloads available on code.google.com is no longer the latest!



Run your sketch and evaluate in/out status of the digital and analog pins. The GUI is based on ncurses, i.e. run Simuino from a terminal window. Features animation in realtime according to actual delays in sketch.

The perfect tool for anybody who wants to get started with Arduino Sketch construction.

It is also possible to construct scenarios regarding analogRead, digitalRead and External Interrupts.

The purpose is to make the construction of a sketch easier. You can verify the functionality without having the Arduino board available. Simuino runs the sketch and shows the status of the digital,analog pins and serial output.

Source:  C++
Platform: Linux (Ubuntu)

Way of working:<br>
1. Start Simuino<br>
2. Load your sketch into your editor of choice. <br>
3. Edit logic,scenario data, log-text.<br>
4. Load sketch into Simuino (command load in Simuino)<br>
5. Evalute simulation by stepping in Simuino. Set values on the fly.<br>
Repeat 3,4,5 until wanted result.<br>
